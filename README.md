# Wynn-Drive-Utility
This is miniOS-linux/driveutility with my 1MiB alignment patch.
https://github.com/minios-linux/driveutility
The miniOS driveutility is a fork of LinuxMint's mintstick.
It is better than mintstick as it combines the ISO writer and formatter programs into one.
It also supports formatting internal drives unlike mintstick.
It also supports zeroing out drives unlike mintstick.
It also supports creating disk images unlike mintstick.
It also supports writing disk images in more formats than just ISO. Unlike mintstick.
The only thing it can't do is write GPT partition tables or format a drive to have more than one partition.
Use the Gnome Disks app for those instead.
